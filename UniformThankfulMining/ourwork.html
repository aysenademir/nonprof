    <h1>Our Work</h1>
    <p>At Helping Kids Nonprofit, we are dedicated to making a difference for children in need. Here are the initiatives we actively implement with our team:</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Care Package Assembly</h2>
        <p>We gather essential items like toiletries, snacks, and school supplies, and assemble care packages for children in orphanages. This initiative helps provide comfort and support to those who need it most.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Book Drive</h2>
        <p>We collect gently used books from our community and organize a book drive. The books are then donated to local orphanages and schools to promote literacy and learning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Craft Day Events</h2>
        <p>We host craft days where our team creates fun art projects and toys for children in orphanages. These activities not only bring joy but also encourage creativity among the kids.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Fun Day at the Park</h2>
        <p>We organize enjoyable days at local parks where we host games, picnics, and activities for children from shelters. This provides them with a day of fun and relaxation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>School Supply Distribution</h2>
        <p>We purchase and collect school supplies, and then hold distribution events to help children prepare for the school year. This ensures that every child has the tools they need to succeed in their education.</p>
